NEW FEATURE ONLINE!!

The app has a new and exciting feature - the chatGPT robot with GPT-3.5 API! This feature allows users to interact with a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that can carry out conversations, answer questions, and offer suggestions based on the user's inputs. The chatGPT robot feature brings a whole new level of interactivity and engagement to the app.

The app also features an auto-scrolling functionality that automatically scrolls to the bottom of the chat window when switching chatrooms.
