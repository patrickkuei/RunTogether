# RunTogether

Introducing our SSR instant communication app that offers users a seamless messaging experience with customizable emojis, multiple chatroom options, and an auto-scrolling function that brings convenience to your fingertips.

Our app also comes with a sidebar that can be toggled to fit different window sizes, ensuring a comfortable and customizable user experience.

But that's not all - we are excited to announce the integration of our latest feature, the chatGPT robot with GPT-3.5 API. This advanced natural language processing model enables users to engage in conversations, ask questions, and receive personalized suggestions based on their inputs, taking user engagement to a whole new level.

We've also made it easy for you to read AI's coding posts with our new code block feature. Simply ask AI to code in any language you like and the code will be automatically surrounded by code blocks for ease of reading.
